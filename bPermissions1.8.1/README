Version 2.3 of bPermissions brings about completely new commands structures

Commands are now a sequence of commands rather than one horribly long string!

Examples:
/world home
/user codename_B
/user addgroup admin

Negative permissions?
Just prefix the permission node with the "^" symbol for example "^node2.node" will mean that player.hasPermission("node2.node") will return false nomatter what.

Spacing?
Yes, unfortunately the expanding config file means spacing has had to be added to the config files.
Remember, if you can't format yaml correctly, you can always do everything by the commands!
